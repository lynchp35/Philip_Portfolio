# Artist Recommender System


The goal for this project was to build an artist recommendation system based on the last FM dataset. The dataset can be found through this [link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/). 

My work can be split into four main parts. 

1. The first part is my initial analysis of the data ([01_initial data_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/lynchp35/DS_4th_Year/blob/main/CA4015/Assignment%203%20Recommender%20Systems/01_initial_data_analysis.ipynb "Python Notebook")), here I do some simple cleaning and pre-processing of the data using the Python libraries Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisation.
2. The next part includes two Python scripts web scraper.py and web scraper tags.py, both scripts are used to scrape additional data from the last FM website.
3. The third part can be found in the notebook 02 further data analysis.ipynb, I used this notebook to do further analysis of the processed data.
4. The final and most interesting part is the recommendation system found in the notebook recommender system.ipynb. The motivation that I had for this notebook was to create a similar user experience to the setup process of Spotify. I wanted to create an interactive application where a user can input data on themselves such as their favourite music genres, artists, and their rating of them.
